        <p>All black & white developing is done by our skilled lab team. 
        We mainly use the developer Rodinal and Ilford chemistry in order to get you the best contrast and range of tones from your film. 
        With Rodinal we garantee that your films will be developed with fresh chemistry everytime.<br>
        We also have other developers that we might use if it’s more suitable for special cases.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, every negative is scanned frame by frame, 
        correcting the density of each one individually to get the most quality from each image.</p>
